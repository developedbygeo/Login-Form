# Login Form

![image info](./src/img/sample.jpg)

A sample, responsive login form, based on the Validation Constraint API. Built mobile-first, it features data validation, based on both the API and JS regex. Additionally, there is dynamic styling based on the viewport, along with GSAP animations when loading.

The main goal of this project was to become more familiar with the API and also learn more about GSAP, ES6 modules, Webpack and Babel.
